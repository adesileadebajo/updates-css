    <h1>ABOUT MYSELF</h1>
    <img src="images/selfie.jpg" alt="My Selfie" width="150" height="220" class="second">

    <p>My name is Adebajo Adesile Azeez. I hail from Ijebu Igbo, a culturally rich town in Ogun State, Nigeria. I currently reside in Abeokuta, where I work as a technician at an automation company. In my role, I handle various technical responsibilities related to automation systems, which has helped me build strong problem-solving skills and hands-on experience in the field.
        <br>
        <p> By nature, I’m a quiet and reserved person—an introvert who enjoys thoughtful reflection and working in focused environments. Although I may come across as shy, I’m highly observant, detail-oriented, and committed to doing meaningful work.
        <br>
        <p> In addition to my job, I’m currently learning web development at IOTB Tech. This new journey has been both exciting and challenging, and it reflects my passion for continuous learning and expanding my skill set in the tech world. I'm particularly interested in how the web connects people and ideas, and I'm eager to eventually build useful, user-friendly applications.
        <br>
        <p> Outside of work and learning, I enjoy spending my free time playing video games, watching movies, and listening to music. These hobbies help me unwind and stay inspired creatively. Whether it’s immersing myself in a great story, discovering new music, or exploring the latest in gaming, I find joy in each experience.</p>
